            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="text">I am <strong>Pham Hoang Duy</strong>, a junior Computer Science student at Michigan State University with a
                strong foundation in software development, algorithm engineering, and cloud computing. My coursework in
                Object-Oriented Software Development, Computer Architecture, and Algorithm Engineering has strengthened
                my problem-solving skills and technical expertise. I am proficient in Java, Python, C++, SQL, and
                JavaScript, with experience in backend development, REST API design, and microservice architecture.
                Additionally, my ability to learn quickly and collaborate effectively has enabled me to excel in both
                academic and professional settings.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                During my internship at Techcom Securities, I worked as an Application Developer, contributing to the
                development of a margin loan product that improved financial accessibility. I built and optimized REST
                APIs using Java and PostgreSQL, implemented backend services with Maven and Docker, and collaborated
                with cross-functional teams using Git and Jira. My role required troubleshooting complex issues,
                optimizing data processing, and ensuring secure and scalable software solutions, all of which
                strengthened my backend development expertise.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Beyond my professional experience, I have worked on several projects, including a Microservice
                Application that serves as a document management system. This project involved developing Flask-based
                microservices, designing SQLite databases, and implementing JWT-based authentication for secure data
                handling. Additionally, I collaborated on a Unity 3D fighting game, where I focused on game physics,
                collision detection, and dynamic character movement. These projects have enhanced my ability to design,
                develop, and optimize scalable applications, and I am eager to bring this experience to innovative
                real-world challenges. Passionate about problem-solving and innovation, I am eager to apply my technical skills to impactful
                and dynamic environments.
